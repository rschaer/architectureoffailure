# Architecture of Failure

Architecture of Failure is a long-form essay on the metaphysics of collapse: an attempt to map the failure of modern civilization not as an accident, but as an outcome of its design. It traces how human nature, institutional inertia, corrupted incentives, and ecological overshoot converge into a single system of self-destruction. The essay also attempts a framework for reconstruction: design constraints and principles for a post-collapse world grounded in limits, decentralization, and honesty.

It argues that no system should depend on virtue, that power must be made to decay, that trust must be earned and verified, and that economics must obey ecology. The goal is not utopia, but survival with dignity - a civilization built to endure its own flaws.
